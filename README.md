# GISCLE Systems Object Detection Repository!

This repository will contain all the experimentation and programming in relation to the object detection for the dashcam data app. 
We will be creating a Custom Object Detection API using an existing Framework. Research for the best results as well the full code will be posted here.

The demo below shows the stage reached so far...
